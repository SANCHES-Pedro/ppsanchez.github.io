I am a PhD student at The University of Edinburgh supervised by Professor [Sotirios Tsaftaris](https://vios.science/team/tsaftaris) and Dr [Alison O’Neil](https://vios.science/team/oneil). My research is focused on the intersection between causality and machine learning applied to healthcare data.

Before the PhD, I was a research engineer at [Canon Medical Research Europe](https://research.eu.medical.canon/). I hold a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Strasbourg / France and a double degree in electrical engineering and biomedical engineering from the University of Brasilia / Brazil and the University of Strasbourg / France.  Previously, I did internships at General Electric Healthcare, Samsumg Research Brazil and ICube laboratory.
