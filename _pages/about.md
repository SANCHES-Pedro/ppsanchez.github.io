I am a PhD student at The University of Edinburgh supervised by Professor [Sotirios Tsaftaris](https://vios.science/team/tsaftaris) and Dr [Alison O’Neil](https://vios.science/team/oneil). My research is focused on the intersection between causality and machine learning applied to healthcare data. I am interested in exploring how understanding the causal structure of a problem improves generalization, merging of multimodal information and personalized decision-making in machine learning systems.
 
Previously, I acquired 4+ years of experience in (medical) image processing with deep learning during a MSc, four internships (Canon Medical, General Electric, Samsung, ICube Lab.) and working as a research engineer at [Canon Medical Research Europe](https://research.eu.medical.canon/). I hold a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Strasbourg / France and a double degree in electrical engineering and biomedical engineering from the University of Brasilia / Brazil and the University of Strasbourg / France.  Previously, I did internships at General Electric Healthcare, Samsumg Research Brazil and ICube laboratory.

Please, do reach out for collaborations. I am a huge believer that people from different backgrounds can create more value for the research community and society in general *together*.
I'm interested in / have experience:
* Theory
 1. Diffusion / energy-based models and causality
 2. Disentanglement
 3. Generative Modelling
 4. Object-centric learning
* Applications
 1. Medical imaging (MRI and CT)
 2. Genomics
 3. Utilising healthcare multimodal information
 4. Neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, MS)
 5. Brain Tumour
